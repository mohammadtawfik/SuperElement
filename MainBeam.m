%Problem Data
Nne=2; %Number of nodes per element of the beam
nn=Nne*2-1; %Plynomial degree

Lx=1; %Length in the x-direction
E=10.92; %modulus of elasticity
Thickness=1; %Beam thickness
Width=1; %Beam width

%Evaluating the plate stiffness matrix 
Q=E*Width*Thickness*Thickness*Thickness/12; %EI
%Evaluating the Transformation matrix

%Evaluating the element stiffness matrix 
%KB=CalcLinear1D2DOF(Q,Lx,nn);
KB=CalcLinearExact1D2DOF(Q,Lx,nn);
%KB=CalcLinearLaplace1D2DOF(Q,Lx,Nne);

%You may check that the Eigenvalues of the 
% stiffness matrix will have  
% two (almost) zeros at the beginning
% followed by positive numbers
% UP TO 7 nodes (14 DOF)
% after that, the results of the program 
% become INVALID!!!
%Using the Modified Lagrange Polynomials
% the program produced valid results
% were valid uo to 12 nodes per element (24 DOF)
% which is the limit of the 12 point numerical
% integration scheme used
%Using the exact integration, 
% the results improved one degree
% compared to the classical method
% the scheme failed after 8 nodes per element (16 DOF)
