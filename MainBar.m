%You may check that the Eigenvalues of the 
% stiffness matrix will have  
% ALL-but-one (almost) zeros at the beginning
% UP TO 16 nodes 
% after that, the results of the program 
% become INVALID as you start getting significant
% NEGATIVE eigenvalues!!!
%Using Lagrange polynomials
% the program failed after 24 DOF!!!
% which is th limit of accuracy of the
% numerical integration scheme used
%Using the exact integration,
% the element failed after 14 nodes
% which indicates the inntroduction of
% other errors in the matrix evaluation process
